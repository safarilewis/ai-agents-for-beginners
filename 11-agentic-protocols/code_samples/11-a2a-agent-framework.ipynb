    "## What is the A2A Protocol?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol** is an open standard that enables AI agents to communicate,\n",
    "discover each other, and collaborate — even when they are built on different frameworks or hosted\n",
    "by different services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Discovery** – Agents publish an *Agent Card* that describes their capabilities, making it\n",
    "  easy for other agents (or orchestrators) to find the right specialist for a task.\n",
    "- **Message Passing** – Agents exchange structured messages through a common protocol, so a\n",
    "  request from one agent can be understood and fulfilled by another regardless of its internal\n",
    "  implementation.\n",
    "- **Task Lifecycle** – A2A defines states such as *submitted*, *working*, *completed*, and\n",
    "  *failed*, giving the orchestrator full visibility into how a delegated task is progressing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we simulate A2A-style collaboration by wiring three specialized travel agents\n",
    "into a workflow where each agent contributes its expertise and passes results to the next."
