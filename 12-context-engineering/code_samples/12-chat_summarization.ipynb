    "# Lesson 12 - Chat History Reduction with Agent Scratchpad\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to manage context in long conversations using Microsoft Agent Framework. As conversations grow, the token count increases — eventually exceeding the model's context window. We address this with a **context summarization pattern** and an **agent scratchpad** for persistent memory.\n",

    "## What You'll Learn:\n",
    "1. **Why Context Management Matters**: Understanding token limits and context windows\n",
    "2. **Context-Aware Agents**: Building agents that manage their own conversation context\n",
    "3. **Context Summarization Pattern**: Using tools to condense conversation history\n",
    "4. **Agent Scratchpad**: Persistent memory that survives context reduction\n",

    "In this lesson you learned how to manage context in long-running agent conversations using Microsoft Agent Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "- **Context windows are finite** — every token in the conversation history costs money and counts toward the limit.\n",
    "- **Summarization tools** let the agent condense accumulated context into compact summaries, reducing token usage while preserving essential information.\n",
    "- **Agent scratchpads** provide persistent external memory that survives any conversation reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Built\n",
    "- A **context-aware agent** that maintains continuity across multi-turn conversations\n",
    "- A **summarization tool** (`summarize_preferences`) that records key user details in a compact format\n",
    "- A **multi-turn conversation** demonstrating context retention and change handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "- **Customer Service Bots**: Remember preferences across long support sessions\n",
    "- **Personal Assistants**: Track ongoing projects without re-explaining context\n",
    "- **Educational Tutors**: Maintain student progress across many interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "- Implement a full scratchpad tool with file-based persistence\n",
    "- Add automatic history truncation after summarization\n",
    "- Combine with vector databases for semantic memory search\n",
    "- Build agents that can resume conversations days later with full context"
